name: Composition of operations

  Let's look at an example:

  ```python
  print(2 * 4 * 5 * 10)
  ```

  The operations can be combined with each other to calculate increasingly complex compound expressions. To give you an idea of how calculations are done inside the interpreter, let's look at an example: `2 * 4 * 5 * 10`.

  1. First, we calculate `2 * 4` and get the expression `8 * 5 * 10`
  2. Then `8 * 5`. The result is `40 * 10`
  3. Then, we get the last multiplication, which gives us `400`

  Operations may contain different operators, which raises the question of their priority.

instructions: |

  Write a program that calculates and prints the value of this expression:

  ```
  8 / 2 + 5 - -3 / 2
  ```

  Don't calculate anything manually, your program should do all the calculations on its own.
