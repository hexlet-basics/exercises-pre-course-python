description: |
  Python is a popular and promising language. It is often chosen as the first language to learn programming.
  We will learn Python from scratch, from the very basics. The first module is a springboard to writing meaningful programs. In it, we'll figure out how to give a computer a command in Python. We'll tell you what comments are and what they're for. On the example of checking your decisions on the site we'll consider what testing is and how to read test output. We'll explain why you shouldn't break grammar rules of the programming language.
