  Almost all programming languages allow you to leave comments in your code. The interpreter ignores them. They're only for people; they let the programmer leave notes for themselves and other programmers.

  They allow you to add explanations of how the code works, what errors need to be corrected, or what you need to remember to add later:

  ```python
  # Delete the line below after the registration task is done
  print(10)
  ```

  Comments in Python begin with the `#` sign and can appear anywhere in the program. They can take up an entire line. If one line is not enough, you can create several comments:

  ```python
  # For Winterfell!
  # For Lanisters!
  ```

  The comment can be on the line after the code:

  ```python
  print('I am the King') # For Lannisters!
  ```

  Create a one-line comment with the text: `You know nothing, Jon Snow!`
