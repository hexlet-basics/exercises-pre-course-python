name: Hello, world!
theory: |
  Learning a new programming language traditionally begins with 'Hello, world!'. It is a simple program that both displays a greeting on the screen, and introduces the new language, showing its syntax and its program structure.

  <pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>
    Hello, World!
  </pre>

  This tradition is over forty years old, so we're not thinking of breaking it any time soon. In the first lesson, we'll write a program called `Hello, world!`. To do this, you have to give the computer a special command. In Python, it's: `print()`.

instructions: |
  Copy the exact code from the instructions into the editor and run it by clicking “Run”.

  ```python
  print('Hello, World!')
  ```

  Note: if you write `heLLo, woRld!` instead of `Hello, World!`, it will be considered different text, because upper and lower case letters are different characters and different _registers_. In programming, the register almost always matters, so get used to always paying attention to it!
