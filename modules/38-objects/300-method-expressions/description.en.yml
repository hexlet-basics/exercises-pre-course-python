name: Methods as expressions
theory: |

  Methods are expressions, like variables or function calls, which means they can be combined in different ways.

  For example, you can use them in operations:

  ```python
  name = 'Shaya'
  'hi, ' + name.upper() + '!'  # hi, SHAYA!
  ```

  Or in function parameters:

  ```python
  name = 'robb'
  print(name.lower())  # => robb
  num1 = 5
  num2 = 30
  # bit_length() - calculates the number of bits needed to represent a number in binary form
  print(num1.bit_length() + num2.bit_length())  # => 8
  ```


instructions: |

  Find the characters *N* and *,* (comma) inside the text in the `text` variable. Print their indices on the screen. Expected output from the tests:

  <pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>
  Index Of N: 0
  Index Of ,: 25
  </pre>

  Your task is to find these indices in the string using the `.find()` method and put them in `print()` without using intermediate variables. If you want to split the output into two lines, you may need `\n`.
