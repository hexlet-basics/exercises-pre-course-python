name: Variable naming
theory: |

  `greeting` is an example of a simple name, but not all names are that simple. Often they include several words: for example, «username». Different languages have different naming styles for variables.

  Three main variable naming conventions are sometimes combined. These conventions apply to variable names consisting of several words:

  * **kebab-case** — the constituent words of the variable are separated by a hyphen (`my-super-var`)
  * **snake\_case** — underscores (`my_super_var`) are used to separate the parts
  * **CamelCase** — each word in the variable is capitalized (`MySuperVar`)

  Variables in Python are generally named in the `snake_case` style; words are written in lowercase letters and separated by an underscore `_`. For more details, you can study the section [«How to name variables»](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions) in the PEP8 standard.

  At [Hexlet](https://hexlet.io/) we start with linters nigh on straight away.

  Next, let's look at an example of bad practices and consider why they should be avoided.

instructions: |

  Create two variables named «first number» and «second number» in English using snake_case. Write `20` into the first variable and `-100` into the second variable. Print the product of the numbers written in the resulting variables.

  The code will work with any name, and we only check the printed result, so the task is up to you.
