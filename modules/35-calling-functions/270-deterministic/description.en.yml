name: Determinacy
theory: |

  Functions in every programming language have fundamental properties. These properties help predict the behavior of functions, how to test them, and where to use them. These properties include determinacy.

  A deterministic function returns the same result every time if the input parameters are the same. For example, a function that counts the number of characters can be called deterministic:

  ```python
  len('hexlet')  # 6
  len('hexlet')  # 6

  len('wow')  # 3
  len('wow')  # 3
  ```

  You can call this function and pass the value `'hexlet'` as many times as you want, and it will always return `6`.

  Let's also look at the reverse case: nondeterministic functions. For example, a function that returns a random number belongs to this category: we will always get different results even if we use the same input. If at least one in a million calls to a function returns a different result, it is considered nondeterministic. This applies even if it doesn't take parameters:

  ```python
  # Import syntax will be studied later in Hexlet
  from random import random

  # A function that returns a random number
  random()  # 0.09856613113197676
  random()  # 0.8839904367241888
  ```

  Determinism is an important property of a function, as it affects many aspects. For example, deterministic functions are convenient to work with, as they're easy to optimize and test. If possible, it's better to make the function deterministic.

  The `random()` function returns a random number from 0 to 1 with many decimal places. Implement code that displays a random integer between 0 and 10. For this task, you need the `random()` function and the [round()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round), function, which rounds the value passed to it

  ```python
  round(2.320000789855705) # 2
  ```

  ## Algorithm
  Since `random()` returns numbers between 0 and 1, we need to multiply by 10 to get numbers between 0 and 10. Then we round the result to get what we need.
